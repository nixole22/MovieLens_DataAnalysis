# MovieLens_DataAnalysis
Power BI Project using CSV files

### Introduction
MovieLens is has an online database of informtion related to films, television series, and online streaming content. 
A three page report with engaging and digestable visuals and intuitive navigation is required to present to an audience 
that is launching a new collection of films this year.

### Problem Statement:
In order to create the "Movie Talkies: Classic" edition, the challenge lies in effectively analyzing and presenting a 
wealth of information about movies from a bygone era. The core issue is understanding the characteristics of these 
classic movies, user interests, and the relationship between user demographics and movie ratings. Without clear visuals, 
it's difficult to identify patterns, draw meaningful conclusions, and engage the audience on a deeper level. You have 
been hired as a Data Analyst by the company, to create a report that provides a detailed analysis of the classic movies 
that were released till 2000. 

#### The dashboard should provide insights on the following questions:
1.	How many movies were released until 2000? How many distinct genres have come up till the year 2000?
2.	How many users are part of the MovieLens community, and what is the gender diversity in this community?
3.	What are the genre preferences of different genders, highlighting user engagement?
4.	What's the average user rating for classic movies, reflecting overall reception? How does the distribution of movies vary across different genres?
5.	How does the demographic distribution of the users look like across gender? Where do these users live?
6.	How do users across different age groups and professions engage with classic movies, revealing generational interests?
7.	Which classic movies and genres are top-rated? How do these ratings differ based on user age and occupation?
8.	Is there a link between user age and the ratings they provide for classic movies, providing insights into age-related viewing habits? How do the average ratings vary over the years based on the genre considered?
